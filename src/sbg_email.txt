Jack,

Thanks for getting back to me and letting us know about what SBG is able to offer. We are still interested in the Ellipse series of INS products, mainly the Ellipse-N and Ellipse2-N, and are curious to see what the final cost of these would be given that discount. Currently our team is working hard to set up our software framework using existing datasets available to us and will not need the INS until late August / early September when our team is back at Purdue. 

We have seen how effective SBG's products are and think it would be perfect for our project. We have a professor from mechanical engineering (Professor Todd Nelson) and a professor from electrical and computer engineering (Professor Aly El Gamal) as advisors, ready to help us develop the project.

Please let me know if there is any more information I can provide. It would be a tremendous help to be able to use one of SBG's INS products.

Thanks,
